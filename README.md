# SYF Lab — Systemic Foundation

This repository is the **orientation hub** for the SYF (Systemic Foundation) project.

SYF is **not a software product**.  
It is a **scientific framework** centered around a minimal, law-bearing core (SYF Core),  
and a set of derived instruments used for observation and experimentation.

This hub exists to:
- present the global structure,
- clarify the order of components,
- and prevent misinterpretation of the project.

No code lives here.  
Only canonical documentation and links.

## Structure Overview

The project follows a strict epistemological order:

```
SYF Core   → law
FRAME-R    → signal framing
CoreXalt   → interfaces & extensions
```

Each layer has a distinct role.  
No feedback into the core is permitted.
